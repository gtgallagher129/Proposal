    <h1>Proposal “Landmines”</h1>
        <p>I am choosing to do a project in javascript.
        It will be very much like the game minesweeper.
        </p>

    <h2>Team Members</h2>

    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
        <p>This will be a game. There will be a certain number of mines scattered amount a grid.
        The player's goal will be to dig out all non-mine squares, and find the position of all mines. 
        Once that is done, the game is won.
        </p>

    <h2>Technology Overview </h2>
        <p>This game is going to be coded through javascript and played within any terminal window.
        I will likely have to import a random number generator. Because it will be on javascript I will 
        host through Azure.
        </p>

    <h2>Proposal Last Updated</h2>
        <p>4/8/22
        </p>

    <h2>Feature List</h2>
        <p>I hope for the game to allow have a grid, have a validator for user inputs, many loops,
         and selections.</p>

    <h2>Future Feature List</h2>
        <p>I have yet to see if where I will finish with this project, but if I had more time I would
        likely make the game more visually apealing. I think a good user interface would be nice
        ,but it's not needed.
        </p>
    
    <h2>Basic Technical Features</h2>
        <p>I will use loops, and sequences a lot. Input system and validation.</p>
    
    <h2>Advanced Technical Features</h2>
        <p>It seems that some things we haven't worked with yet are going to need to be a part of this.
        I think I will need to use a random number generator, and that with there may be some issues.
        I was also reading that recursion will be something I will need to gain an understanding of.
